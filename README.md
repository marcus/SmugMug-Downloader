# SmugMug Downloader
Download all of the pictures from a SmugMug user, including password-protected users (you must know the password). This method is slightly inefficient, but works without requiring a SmugMug API key or any other information.

## Installation
* Install Python 3
* Clone this repository or download it as a zip
* Install the requirements:  `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* NOTE: If you are on Linux, you will probably need to type `pip3` and `python3` instead

## Changes in this version

	•	Logging: A logging system has been implemented. Logs will be written to the file smugmug_downloader.log in the output directory, and only INFO level messages and above will be shown in the console.
	•	Sanitized filenames: Filenames are now sanitized to replace any special characters with underscores (_), preventing issues with invalid filenames.
	•	Error handling: Improved error handling for downloading albums, retrieving images, and handling missing attributes such as MD5Sum or id.

## Usage
* Run `python smdl.py -u USERNAME` and it will begin downloading your pictures into separate folders in the default output directory. The username is what is found in the URL, i.e. USERNAME.smugmug.com.
* Some SmugMug sites are organized with [folders and hierarchy](https://www.smugmughelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/18212469747604-Organize-with-folders-and-hierarchy); if you would like to restrict your download to certain folders, you can directly put the relevant path into the username (USERNAME.smugmug.com/a/b/c would become `-u USERNAME/a/b/c`).
* To specify the output directory, use the `-o` flag: `python smdl.py -u USERNAME -o output`
* If the user requires an unlock password, you must sign in using the password in your web browser, then copy over the SMSESS cookie. In Google Chrome, you can view your cookies by pressing `Ctrl-Shift-I`, then go to the Application tab, go to the  Cookies dropdown, and click on https://USERNAME.smugmug.com. Then copy the value of the SMSESS cookie. You can then paste this cookie as an argument: `python smdl.py -u USERNAME -s 
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`
* For a full list of command-line options, run `python smdl.py -h`, or see below:
